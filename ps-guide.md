# Problem set guidelines:

I will assign problem sets, consisting of one or more small design challenges weekly, for the first five weeks of class. These problems are exercises designed to get familiar with tools and processes that will come in handy later. We will start the problem sets together in class. Print versions should be posted on the wall at the start of the next class.

Unless told otherwise, problem set solutions will delivered both digitally and as physical prints.

Prints should be on single 8Â½ x 11" white letter pages.
Online solutions will be reviewed on a 1024 x 768 chrome browser. The URL to the solution should be "github-username/ps-number/index.html" eg: "knowuh/ps-01/index.html"
Print versions of the solutions should include the following information at the top:

* Your Name
* The date, in the form "YYYY-MM-DD"
* The problem set number, in the form of "PS-XX"

Solutions will be critiqued in class. They may be simple sketches, but they should be 'buttoned up' for presentation. Together we will discuss the solution's approach, process, and form.

## Tips:

* Sketch first with pencil and paper. Worst case scenario: cheat by  embedding your sketch into a web page.
* Focus on the digital version first, print later.  Worst case print scenario: cheat by screen capping the browser and  edit in image manipulation software.
* Landscape orientation for print solutions will match the aspect ratio of screen experience.
* If forced to choose between decent print presentation and decent digital presentation, favor the digital presentation.
