# Problem set guidelines:

I will assign weekly problem sets (design challenges) in the first five weeks of class. These exercises are designed to expose you to tools and processes that will be critical to completing capstone projects. We will start the problem sets together in class. Online versions of the problems sets will be delivered by Github 'pull requests' on this repository (TBD). You will work in a git branch named `github-username`. Print versions should be posted on the wall at the start of the next class.

Unless told otherwise, problem set solutions will delivered both digitally and as physical prints.

Prints should be on single 8Â½" x 11" white letter pages.
Online solutions will be reviewed in class on a 1024 x 768 Chrome browser. The URL to the solution should be `<github-username>/ps-number/index.html` e.g.: `knowuh/ps-01/index.html`.

Solutions should include the following information somewhere:

* Your name
* The date, in the form `YYYY-MM-DD`
* The problem set number, in the form of `PSXX-x`, e.g.: `PS01-a`

Solutions will be critiqued in class. They may be sketches, but they should be 'buttoned up' for presentation. Together we will discuss the solution's approach, process, and form.

## Tips:

* Produce very rough thumbnail sketches of several ideas first on pencil and paper.
* Move from pencil sketches, focus on the digital version first, print later.  Worst case scenario: cheat with a screen-shot or print to pdf. Enhance in an image manipulation software or illustrator.
* Landscape orientation for print solutions will match the aspect ratio of screen experience.
* If forced to choose between decent print presentation and decent digital presentation, favor the digital presentation.
