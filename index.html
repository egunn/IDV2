          <h1>Information Design Visualization Studio 2</h1>
          <h3><a id="Structure"></a>Course Structure:</h3>
            <p>The first five weeks of this studio build a foundational experience
              with tools, and practices critical to completing the final
              portfolio project.
              In this period, students are given design challenges to explore
              portfolio topics and data in a low risk environment.
              These fast iterations establish a processes and cadence required for
              completing final projects. The sketches will be started
              collaboratively in class, however students are expected to complete
              and apply finishing touches on the exercises outside for
              presentation the following week.
              Enrichment materials will be assigned in this period to encourage
              new directions of exploration. Each week one student will also lead
              a 10 minute design analysis on a datavisualization piece
              ‘found in the wild’. After five weeks, the emphasis of the studio
              shifts to the production of the final portfolio project.
              The daily structure is unchanged, but technical demonstrations are
              replaced by charette and hands on work directly producing and
              refining the portfolio piece.
            </p>
          <h3><a id="Weekly_Structure"></a>Weekly Structure:</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><code>5:30 – 6:20</code>
              <strong>Critique &amp; charette</strong>.
              Work from previous week is presented at the start of the class.
              Students are expected to discuss: the formal elements,
              visual impact, legibility, social context,
              and implications of the work presented.
              Presenters are expected to speak clearly about their intentions,
              process, and pitfalls they encountered.
              Reviewers are expected to suggest next steps for strengthening,
              extending, or rethinking the design. Presenters will demonstrate
              active listening and their willingness to revise, by restating the
              comments and suggestions that most resonated with them.
            </li>
            <li><code>6:20 - 6:30</code> <strong>Student presentation</strong>. Each week a student will present an interactive data vislualization to the class, and lead an design analysis.</li>
            <li><code>6:30 - 6:40</code> <strong>Break</strong>.</li>
            <li><code>6:40 - 7:15</code> <strong>Informal lecture</strong>.  Introduction of new technical material required to complete projects (eg: consuming the twitter API), or design case studies.</li>
            <li><code>7:15 – 8:00</code> <strong>Work together</strong>. We  work together on a single laptop to complete code that addresses or technical needs. This code is shared on github, and can be used by student teams as a launching point for their work.</li>
            <li><code>8:00 - 8:10</code> <strong>Break</strong>.</li>
            <li><code>8:10 - 9:00</code> <strong>Independent or team work</strong>. Students work alone or in small groups on portfolio / challenge. This is a great time for students to help each other, or ask me for help.</li>
