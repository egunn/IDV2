# IDV Studio 2 Syllabus

### Objective
Students will leave the Information Design and Visualization Studio 2 knowing the processes and tools required to create and publish interactive data visualizations on schedule. They will be comfortable sketching and presenting rough ideas for feedback. They will favor an iterative design process to refine ideas and meet deadlines. Students will be able to articulate design and editorial decisions made during project planning meetings. Students will have created a compelling project for their portfolio, that demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of data and visual design.

### Structure
The first five weeks of this studio build a foundational experience with tools, and practices critical to completing the final portfolio project. In this period, students are given design challenges to explore portfolio topics and data in a low risk environment. These fast iterations establish a processes and cadence required for completing final projects. The sketches will be started collaboratively in class, however students are expected to complete and apply finishing touches on the exercises outside for presentation the following week. Enrichment materials will be assigned in this period to encourage new directions of exploration. Each week one student will also lead a 10 minute design analysis on a data visualization piece 'found in the wild'. After five weeks, the emphasis of the studio shifts to the production of the final portfolio project. The daily structure is unchanged, but technical demonstrations are replaced by charette and hands-on work directly producing and refining the portfolio piece.

### Grading:
Students will show weekly progress in their ability to discuss, design, and implement compelling data visualization solutions.

The grading system follows the [University Policies](http://www.northeastern.edu/registrar/gradingsystem.html).

##### Criteria:
* __70% Project work – presentation, and defense:__ Data visualizations will be evaluated on clarity, efficiency, originality, and emotional impact. Project work should be grounded in data, informed by critical thinking, guided by cognitive principles, and refined on the basis of feedback given in class. The project should communicate on its own, but students are expected to identify and defend the design decisions made in the process.
* __20% class participation:__ The studio is a community. Modern design challenges require collaboration and communication. Students are expected to offer respectful and insightful design critique. Students must offer sophisticated and challenging ideas in design charettes. Students in this studio are expected to challenge and elevate each other.
* __10% peer evaluation:__ As a community, students will be evaluated in part their peers.

##### Integrity
Students will abide by Northeastern University’s [Academic Integrity Policy](http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academicintegrity/).

##### Attendance
Students are expected to attend all classes. Absence for health or personal reasons should be communicated to the lecturer. Tardiness and unexcused absences will impact student grades.

### Ongoing work
Students will be producing work to share with the class each week. These may not be "complete" they should be packaged for consumption and critique. The practice of framing in-process material for review is an important skill. Students are expected to keep a sketch book for the purpose of ideation and journaling. These sketches are for the students use only, and will not be formal reviewed. Students should develop the habit of taking notes on data and design encountered from the materials, or found in the wild. Each student will give one 10 minute presentation.

### Weeks
1. `Jan 11` __Orientation__: Overview, agreement, processes.
2. `Jan 25` __Web 101__: Sketching and sharing.
3. `Feb  1` __Programming 101__: Data: collect and consume data.
4. `Feb  8` __Design 101__: Gestalt principles. Color. Grid. Type. Context.
5. `Feb 22` __Programming 102__: Data: filter, shape, visualize.
6. `Feb 29` __Interaction 101__: (MIDPOINT) The interaction mantra. First proposals due.
7. `Mar 14` __TBD__: Driven by project requirements.
8. `Mar 28` __TBD__: Driven by project requirements.
9. `Apr  4` __TBD__: Driven by project requirements.
10. `Apr 11` __TBD__: Driven by project requirements.
11. `Apr 25` __TBD__: Driven by project requirements.

### Weekly Structure
* `5:30 – 6:20` __Critique & charette__. Work from previous week is presented at the start of the class. Students are expected to discuss: the formal elements; visual impact; legibility; social context; and implications of the work presented. Presenters are expected to speak clearly about their intentions, process, and pitfalls they encountered. Reviewers are expected to suggest next steps for strengthening, extending, or rethinking the design. Presenters will demonstrate active listening and their willingness to revise, by restating the comments and suggestions that most resonated with them.
* `6:20 - 6:30` __Student presentation__. Each week a student will present an interactive data visualization to the class, and lead an design analysis.
* `6:30 - 6:40` __Break__.
* `6:40 - 7:15` __Informal lecture__.  Introduction of new technical material required to complete projects (eg: consuming the twitter API), or design case studies.
* `7:15 – 8:00` __Work together__. We  work together on a single laptop to complete code that addresses or technical needs. This code is shared on github, and can be used by student teams as a launching point for their work.
* `8:00 - 8:10` __Break__.
* `8:10 - 9:00` __Independent or team work__. Students work alone or in small groups on portfolio / challenge. This is a great time for students to help each other, or ask me for help.
